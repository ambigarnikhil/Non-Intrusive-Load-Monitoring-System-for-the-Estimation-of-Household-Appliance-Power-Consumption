<h2>🛠️ Installation Steps:</h2>

<p>1. REDD Dataset</p>

```
http://redd.csail.mit.edu/
```

<p>2. The dataset directory contains average power readings for both the two power mains and the individual circuits of the house. The main directory consists of several 6 houses directories each of which contain all the power readings for a single house. Each house subdirectory consists of a labels.dat and several channels_i.dat files. The labels file contains channel numbers and a text label indicating the general category of device on this channel.</p>
